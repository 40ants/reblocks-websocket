0.2.0
=====

* Fixed to work under the Woo server (but others aren't supported for
  now), because this version of weblocks-websocket depends on a hack
  from the
  https://github.com/svetlyak40wt/websocket-driver/tree/make-woo-work-from-separate-threads
  branch, made in the
  https://github.com/svetlyak40wt/websocket-driver/commit/f9955b1fd99bac6cb744b72c734c7d845922ff6a commit.

0.1.1 (unreleased)
==================

* Now macro ``in-thread`` removes header ``X-Requested-With`` from
  captured request object. This requires ``weblocks >= 0.14.4``.

0.1.0 (unreleased)
==================

* Number features here.
* Like that.
* Add new versions to the top.
* Specify dates as ``2017-04-19``.
* Read `KeepAChangelog.com <http://keepachangelog.com/>`_ for futher
  explanations.
